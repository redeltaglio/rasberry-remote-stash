
                            FOURSCORE
                       AND SEVEN YEARS AGO
                    OUR FATHERS         BROUGHT
                FORTH ON THIS              CONTINENT
            A NEW NATION CONCEIVED      IN       LIBERTY
          AND DEDICATED TO  THE                   PROPOSITION
         THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED    EQUAL.                NOW
        WE ARE ENGAGED  IN A GREAT  CIVIL                   WAR
        TESTING WHETHER THAT NATION  OR                      ANY
       NATION SO CONCIEVED  AND     SO                       DEDI-
      CATED CAN LONG ENDURE.      WE     ARE                  MET
      ON A GREAT BATTLEFIELD        OF     THAT               WAR
     WE HAVE COME TO DEDICATE        A      PORTION OF THAT FIELD
      AS A FINAL RESTING PLACE                  FOR THOSE WHO
      HERE GAVE THEIR  LIVES                       THAT THAT
     NATION MIGHT        LIVE.                            IT
    IS ALTOGETHER       FITTING                          AND
    PROPER THAT WE        SHOULD                     DO THIS.
    BUT IN A  LARGER      SENSE WE            CANNOT DEDICATE,
    WE CANNOT CONSECRATE, WE CANNOT            HALLOW THIS
    GROUND. THE BRAVE MEN, LIVING AND              DEAD
    WHO STRUGGLED HERE HAVE CONSECRATED IT    FAR   O
     ABOVE OUR POOR POWER TO       ADD              L
     OR DETRACT       THE        WORLD               D
     WILL LITTLE NOTE  NOR         LONG              A
     REMEMBER WHAT WE   SAY         HERE,             B
      BUT CAN NEVER FORGET           WHAT             E
       THEY DID HERE.   IT IS         FOR US        THE
        LIVING RATHER    TO BE              DEDICATED"
          HERE TO THE UNFINISHED           WORK"
           WHICH THEY WHO FOUGHT           HERE
          HAVE THUS FAR SO   NOBLY    ADVANCED.
       IT IS RATHER    FOR US  TO BE       HERE
     DEDICATED          TO  THE GREAT     TASK
   REMAINING              BEFORE US, THAT FROM
 THESE HONORED             DEAD WE TAKE INCREASED
 DEVOTION TO THAT             CAUSE FOR WHICH  THEY
 GAVE THE LAST FULL              MEASURE OF DEVOTION
 THAT, WE HERE HIGHLY         RESOLVE  THAT THESE;;"
    DEAD SHALL NOT HAVE        DIED      IN VAIN
       THAT THIS NATION UNDER GOD
          SHALL HAVE A NEW BIRTH OF
            FREEDOM AND THAT GOVERNMENT
             OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE,
              FOR THE PEOPLE, SHALL
              NOT PERISH FROM
                THIS EARTH.
