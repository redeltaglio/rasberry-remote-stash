   WASHINGTON IS TELLING US THAT IF WE CAN JUST KEEP INFLATION AT FOUR
PERCENT A YEAR INFLATION WILL BE CONTROLLED.  LET'S SEE HOW CONTROLLED
THAT REALLY IS.
   LET'S ASSUME THAT IN THE YEAR ONE A.D. A DOLLAR WAS WORTH A DOLLAR
AND SINCE THEN INFLATION HAS BEEN CONTROLLED AT 4 PERCENT A YEAR.  NOW
YOU GO TO OUR GOVERNMENT AND DEMAND IN TODAYS DOLLARS THE EQUIVALENT OF
THAT ORIGINAL DOLLAR.  HOW MANY DOLLARS WOULD THEY HAVE TO GIVE YOU?
   TO MAKE THE ANSWER MEANINGFUL LET'S FURTHER ASSUME THEY PAY YOU IN
MILLION DOLLAR BILLS AND EACH BILL WEIGHS ONE GRAM.  THIS IS THE
TRUE WEIGHT OF A BILL BY THE WAY.  NOW HOW MANY GRAMS, POUNDS, TONS
OR WHATEVER UNITS YOU WANT WOULD THEY GIVE YOU?  THE ANSWER IS ONE,
AND THE UNITS ARE EARTHS!!  YEP, IT WOULD TAKE A BIT OVER ONE EARTH'S
WEIGHT TO EQUAL THE NUMBER OF MILLION DOLLAR BILLS NEEDED!
   IF THE INFLATION RATE GETS OUT OF HAND TO SAY 6 PERCENT THEN YOU
WOULD NEED 250,000,000,000,000,000 EARTHS TO PAY OFF.  HIGHER RATES LEAD
TO RIDICULOUS ANSWERS.  BY 12 PERCENT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH MATTER IN THE
ENTIRE KNOWN UNIVERSE EVEN IF ONE SUBATOMIC PARTICLE EQUALLED A MILLION
DOLLARS!
   SO MUCH FOR "CONTROLLED" INFLATION.
