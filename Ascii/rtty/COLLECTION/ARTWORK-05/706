   THIS IS THE SYMBOL WORN BY MANY OF TODAY'S YOUNG PEOPLE
AND IS KNOWN AS THE "PEACE SYMBOL."  WE WONDER HOW MANY OF THEM,
OR YOU FOR THAT MATTER, KNOW THE REAL MEANING OF THIS SYMBOL???

   THE "PEACE SYMBOL" IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS THE PRODUCT OF TODAY'S
RESTLESS YOUTH.  IT WAS WELL KNOWN BACK IN THE MIDDLE AGES AND WAS
KNOWN EITHER AS THE "CROW'S FOOT" OR THE "WITCH'S FOOT."  NOW ARE YOU
READY FOR THE REAL SHOCK???  THIS WAS THE SIGN OF THOSE WHO WERE
OPPOSED TO CHRISTIANITY!!  IT WAS A BROKEN CROSS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN.
NOW DO YOU SEE WHY IT IS A SUBTLE SIGN OF THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED
TO CHRISTIANITY???

   IT IS USED TODAY AS A CENTRAL PART OF THE NATIONAL SYMBOLISM
OF COMMUNIST RUSSIA.  IT APPEARS THE COMMUNISTS ARE WINNING THEIR
BATTLE FOR THE MINDS OF OUR YOUTH.  THEY ARE MAKING SPECIAL EFFORTS
TO CAPTURE THE ATTENTION OF TODAY'S YOUTH IN AMERICA.  MANY YOUNG
PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE PEACE SYMBOL AND WEAR IT AS JEWELRY
AND EVEN PAINT IT ON THEIR CARS.  THEY WEAR IT AS A "FAD" GADGET,
NOT REALIZING THEY ARE SUPPORTING THE EMBLEM OF THE ANTI-CHRIST,
THE BROKEN CROSS.
