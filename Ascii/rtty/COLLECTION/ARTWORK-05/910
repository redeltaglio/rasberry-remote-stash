
A LITTLE OLD MAN AND A LITTLE OLD WOMAN VISITED THE DOCTORS OFFICE
AND SAID THAT THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THEIR SEX LIFE AND WOULD THE 
DOCTOR PLEASE WATCH THEM AND MAYBE HE COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY 
WERE DOING WRONG. THE DOCTOR HAD NEVER HAD SUCH A REQUEST BEFORE AND
OBJECTED TO THAT SORT OF THING BUT THE LITTLE OLD COUPLE TALKED HIM
INTO IT AND AWAY THEY WENT.   A LITTLE BIT LATER THE
DOCTOR SAID THAT FOR AN OLD COUPLE, THEY WERE DOING FINE AND GO ON HOME
AND ENJOY IT.
    A WEEK LATER THE LITTLE OLD COUPLE WERE BACK AND SAID THAT THEY
WERE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM AND WOULD THE DOCTOR PLEASE LOOK AGAIN.
THE DOCTOR OBJECTED AGAIN BUT FINALLY CONSENTED TO WATCH. A LITTLE 
BIT LATER, THE DOCTOR SAID THAT AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE EVERYTHING WAS
JUST FINE AND GO ON HOME AND ENJOY IT.
    THIS HAPPENED ABOUT SIX WEEKS IN A ROW AND FINALLY THE DOCTOR
DECIDED TO TRY AN OTHER APPROACH. THE DOCTOR ASKED THE LITTLE OLD
COUPLE JUST WHAT THEY THOUGHT THE PROBLEM WAS. THEY REPLIED:
    DOC, IF WE GO TO MY HOUSE, MY WIFE COMPLAINS AND IF WE GO TO 
HER HOUSE, HER HUSBAND COMPLAINS. IF WE GO TO A MOTEL, IT COSTS US
$14.00 AND IF WE COME HERE , YOU ONLY CHARGE US $7.50 AND SINCE WE
ARE ON MEDICARE WE CAN CHARGE IT TO THEM.
