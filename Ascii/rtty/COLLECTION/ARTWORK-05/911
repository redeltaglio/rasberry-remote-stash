
I'M SO OLD I CAN REMEMBER WHEN.....

REMEMBER WHEN "HIPPIE" MEANT BIG IN THE HIPS,
AND A "TRIP" INVOLVED TRAVEL IN A CAR, PLANE OR SHIP?
WHEN "POT" WAS A VESSEL FOR COOKING THINGS IN,
AND "HOOKED" WAS WHAT GRANDMOTHER'S RUG MIGHT HAVE BEEN?
WHEN"FIX" WAS A VERB THAT MEANT MEND OR REPAIR,
AND "BE-IN" MEANT SIMPLY EXISTING SOMEWHERE?
WHEN "NEAT" MEANT WELL ORGANIZED,  TIDY AND CLEAN,
AND "GRASS" WAS A GROUND COVER,  NORMALLY GREEN?
WHEN LIGHTS AND NOT PEOPLE WERE "SWITCHED ON AND OFF",
AND THE "PILL" MIGHT HAVE BEEN WHAT YOU TOOK FOR A COUGH?
WHEN "CAMP" MEANT TO QUARTER OUTDOORS IN A TENT,
AND "POP" WAS WHAT THE WEASEL WENT?
WHEN "GROOVY" MEANT FURROWED WITH CHANNELS AND HOLLOWS,
AND "BIRDS" WERE WINGED CREATURES,  LIKE ROBINS AND SWALLOWS?
WHEN "FUZZ" WAS A SUBSTANCE THAT'S FLUFFY LIKE LINT,
AND "BREAD" WAS FROM BAKERIES,  NOT FROM THE MINT,
WHEN "SQUARE" MEANT A 90-DEGREE ANGLED FORM,
AND "COOL" WAS A TEMPERATURE NOT QUITE WARM?
AND "ROLL" MEANT A BUN AND "ROCK" WAS A STONE,
AND "HANG-UP" WAS SOMETHING YOU DID TO THE PHONE?
WHEN "CHICKEN" MEANT POULTRY AND "BAG" WAS A SACK,
AND "JUNK" TRASHY CAST-OFFS AND OLD BRIC-A-BRAC?
WHEN "JAM" WAS PRESERVES THAT YOU SPREAD ON YOUR BREAD,
AND "CRAZY" MEANT BALMY,  NOT RIGHT IN THE HEAD?
WHEN "CAT" WAS A FELINE,  A KITTEN GROWN UP,
AND "TEA" WAS A FLUID THAT YOU DRANK FROM A CUP?
WHEN "SWINGER" WAS SOMEONE WHO SWUNG ON A SWING,
AND "PAD" WAS A SOFT SORT OF CUSHIONY THING?
WHEN "DIG" MEANT TO SHOVEL AND SPADE IN THE DIRT,
AND "PUT ON" WAS WHAT YOU WOULD DO WITH A SHIRT?
WHEN "TOUGH" DESCRIBED MEAT TOO UNYIELDING TO CHEW,
AND "MAKING A SCENE" WAS A RUDE THING TO DO?
IT'S "GROOVY",  "MAN",  "GROOVY",  BUT ENGLISH IT'S NOT,
ME THINKS THAT THE LANGUAGE HAS GONE CLEAR TO "POT".....
