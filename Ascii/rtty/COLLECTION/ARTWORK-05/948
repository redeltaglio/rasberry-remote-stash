SOME OF THE ACCIDENT REPORTS IN THE DISTRICT AND
THE REASONS FOR HAVING ACCIDENTS ARE AS RIDICULOUS
AS THE FOLLOWING AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED:

           AN ENGLISH ACCIDENT REPORT

HERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED TO
A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY WORKER IN THE
BRITISH WEST INDIES.  IN A LETTER TO
HIS EMPLOYER, THE MAN GAVE THIS ACCOUNT
OF HIS ACCIDENT:

     "WHEN I GOT TO THE BUILDING, I FOUND
THAT THE HURRICANE HAD KNOCKED SOME BRICKS
OFF THE TOP.  SO I RIGGED UP A BEAM WITH A
PULLEY AT THE TOP OF THE BUILDING AND HOISTED
UP A COUPLE OF BARRELS OF BRICKS.  WHEN I
FIXED THE BUILDING, THERE WAS A LOT OF BRICKS
LEFT OVER.  I HAULED THE BARREL BACK UP AGAIN
AND SECURED THE LINE AT THE BOTTOM, AND THEN
WENT UP AND FILLED THE BARREL WITH THE EXTRA
BRICKS.  THEN I WENT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM AND
CAST OFF THE LINE."

     "UNFORTUNATELY, THE BARREL OF BRICKS
WAS HEAVIER THAN I WAS AND BEFORE I KNEW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING THE BARREL STARTED DOWN,
JERKING ME OFF THE GROUND.  I DECIDED TO
HANG ON AND HALF WAY UP I MET THE BARREL
COMING DOWN AND RECEIVED A SEVERE BLOW ON
THE SHOULDER.  I THEN CONTINUED TO THE TOP,
BANGING MY HEAD AGAINST THE BEAM, AND GETTING
MY FINGERS JAMED IN THE PULLEY,  WHEN THE
BARREL HIT THE GROUND IT BURST THE BOTTOM,
ALLOWING ALL THE BRICKS TO SPILL OUT."

     "I WAS NOW HEAVIER THAN THE BARREL AND
SO I STARTED DOWN AGAIN AT A HIGH SPEED.  HALF
WAY DOWN I MET THE BARREL COMING UP, AND RECEIVED
SEVERE INJURY TO MY SHINS.  WHEN I HIT THE GROUND,
I LANDED ON THE BRICKS,  GETTING SEVERAL PAINFUL
CUTS FROM THE SHARP EDGES."

     "AT THIS POINT I MUST HAVE LOST MY PRESENCE
OF MIND BECAUSE I LET GO OF THE LINE.  THE BARREL
THEN CAME DOWN GIVING ME ANOTHER HEAVY BLOW ON THE
HEAD AND PUTTING ME IN THE HOSPITAL.

I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST SICK LEAVE."
