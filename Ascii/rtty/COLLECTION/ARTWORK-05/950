                 LORD, GRANT ME THE STRENGTH THAT I
                 MAY NOT FALL
                 INTO THE CLUTCHES OF CHOLESTEROL.
                 AT POLYUNSATURATES, I'LL NEVER MUTTER
                 FOR THE ROAD TO HELL IS PAVED WITH
                 BUTTER
                 AND CAKE IS CURSED AND CREAM IS AWFUL
                 AND SATAN IS HIDING IN EVERY WAFFLE
                 BEELZEBUB IS A CHOCOLATE DROP
                 AND LUCIFER IS A LOLLIPOP
                 TEACH ME THE EVILS OF HOLLANDAISE,
                 OF PASTA AND GOBS OF MAYONNAISE.
                 AND CRISP FRIED CHICKEN FROM THE
                 SOUTH----
                 LORD, IF YOU LOVE ME, SHUT MY MOUTH.
