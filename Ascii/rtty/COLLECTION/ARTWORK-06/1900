                                  TREE
                                   IS
                                 GOD'S
                               CREATION
                              EVERYWHERE
                            ON EARTH - IN-
                          CLUDING BROOKLYN.
                         IT'S SAID MAN ONCE
                       LIVED IN TREES. WHEN HE
                      CLIMBED DOWN, LIFE NEVER
                      AGAIN WAS TO BE QUITE SO
                   SIMPLE...YET ONLY THEN DID THE
                   TREE GET TRULY APPRECIATED. SO
                 HERE WAS FOOD AND FUEL AND SHELTER.
                THEN A WEAPON, A TOOL, A WHEEL - AND
             TRANSPORTATION. AND NOW IT'S FLOORS, DOORS
           VENEERS, PIERS, BASKETS, CASKETS... RUBBER FOR
         GASKETS. IT'S A HANDLE FOR BROOMS, SHOVELS, RAKES
          ...SYRUP ON PANCAKES. IT'S PAPER AND PAINTS...
         TAR, SPARS, BOXES AND BOXCARS... STORAGE BINS AND
       BOWLING PINS. IT'S TOOTHPICKS AND MATCHSTICKS... EVEN
    PLASTICS..  MATERIAL FOR DISTILLATION, LAMINATION, INSULATION
      ... WINDOWS FOR VENTILATION, AND A THOUSAND AND ONE OTHER
   WE-CAN'T-DO-WITHOUTS. YET FEW PEOPLE LOOK AT A TREE IN THE SAME
     WAY. TO THE SMALL BOY ITS A FAVORITE AND STRATEGIC PLACE...
    WHERE YOU BUILD A TREEHOUSE, SPOT A WOODPECKER, CUT SLINGSHOTS
  AND FISHPOLES, HANG OLD TIRES AND CLIMB FOR FUN. TO THE NATURALIST
   IT'S PROBING A FASCINATING WORLD OF BUDS, BLOSSOMS, BARK, NEEDLES,
   CONES AND LEAVES... SPECTACLES OF COLOR... AND SOME 1,035 DOMESTIC
  SPECIES.(YET TO A BASEBALL PLAYER IT'S AS SIMPLE AS A STICK OF SECOND
 -GROWTH ASH, FIXED AND SHAPED TO "FEEL LIKE A MILLION.") TO THE ARTIST
  IT'S INSPIRATION... ALONE ON A WINDSWEPT HILL, TIMBERLINE PATCHWORK
ON A MOUNTAINSIDE, THICK AND VERDANT IN A VALLEY. TO THE HOMEOWNER IT'S
 BEAUTY AND SHADE AND PROPERTY VALUE... ALSO DIGGING, PLANTING PRUNING,
   EDGING, FEEDING AND A LOT OF OTHER WEEKEND WORK. TO THE HOBBYIST AND
    CRAFTSMAN IT'S A NEW BOOKCASE, PICNIC TABLE, PANELLED DEN, PLYWOOD
SHELVES A CHANCE TO BECOME DOWNRIGHT "IMMORTAL". TO THE TIMBERMAN IT'S A
 BUSTLING BIG BUSINESS, MEASURED BY CORDS AND BOARD FEET. BUT MOST OF ALL
A TREE REMAINS WHAT IT WAS IN THE FIRST PLACE.MAN'S EVER-LASTING FRIEND.
                               FOR WE-D SURE
                                BE "STUMPED"
                               FOR A MIGHTY
                               LOT OF THINGS
                                IN A WORLD
                               WITHOUT TREES!
