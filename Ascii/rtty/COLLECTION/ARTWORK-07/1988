
     THE LITTLE RED HEN AND THE FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM.

ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A LITTLE RED HEN WHO SCRATCHED BEHIND
THE BARN AND UNCOVERED SOME OLD RADIO PARTS.  SHE CALLED THE OTHER
ANIMALS IN THE BARNYARD AND SAID:
"IF WE ALL SCRATCH TOGETHER, WE CAN FIND ENOUGH PARTS TO MAKE SOME
HAM GEAR, AND TALK TO OTHER ANIMALS ALL OVER THE WORLD.
"NOT I", SAID THE COW.
"NOT I" SAID THE DUCK.
"UNION DOSEN'T ALLOW ME TO SCRATCH," SAID THE PIG.
"THEN I WILL DIG THEM UP," SAID THE LITTLE RED HEN. AND SHE DID.
WHEN SHE HAD DUG UP ENOUGH PARTS, THE LITTLE RED HEN SAID,
"WHO WILL HELP ME PUT TOGETHER THIS GEAR?"
"NOT I," SAID THE COW. "I WAS A DROPOUT AND DON'T KNOW HOW."
"NOT I, SAID THE DUCK. "I MIGHT LOOSE ON WELFARE BENEFITS IF I
DID SIDEWORK."
"NOT I," SAID THE PIG. "IF I'M THE ONLY ONE HELPING, IT WOULD BE
DISCRIMINATION."
"THEN I WILL,"SAID THE LITTLE RED HEN, AND BUILT A FINE HAM STATION.
"I WANT TO TALK," SAID THE COW. "LET'S YACK WTH SOME GIRLS,
SAID THE DUCK.
"I DEMAND EQUAL AIR TIME, "SAID THE PIG.
"NO," SAID THE LITTLE RED HEN. "I DID IT ALL MYSELF, AND I'M
GOING TO RELAX AND WORK DX".
"CAPITALIST," SAID THE COW. "EQUAL TIME, EQUAL TIME," SQUAWKED THE DUCK.
 "PIG!" SQUEALED THE PIG.
THEY PAINTED BIG SIGNS AND PICKETED THE LITTLE RED HEN'S RADIO SHACK,
AND MARCHED AROUND SINGING "WE SHALL OVER COME." AND THEY DID.
FOR WHEN THE FARMER CAME TO INVESTIGATE THE RACKET, HE SAID,
"YOU MUST NOT BE GREEDY, LITTLE RED HEN. LOOK AT THE OPPRESSED COW.
LOOK AT THE UNDERPRIVILEGED PIG. LOOK AT THE LESS FORTUNATE DUCK.
YOU ARE MAKING SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS OF THEM.
"BUT I BUILT IT ALL MYSELF," SAID THE LITTLE RED HEN.
"FINE," SAID THE FARMER.  "THAT IS THE WONDERFUL FREE ENTERPRISE
SYSTEM.  ANY ONE CAN PROVIDE HIMSELF WITH ANYTHING HE WANTS.
IN MANY BARNYARDS THE FARMER WOULD TAKE IT ALL AWAY FROM YOU. HERE
YOU ONLY MUST SHARE THE FRUITS OF YOUR LABOR WITH YOUR LESS PRIVILEGED
NEIGHBORS."
SO THE LITTLE RED HEN SORROWFULLY DISMANTLED HER RADIO STATION,
AND PAINTED A PROTEST SIGN. AND LEARNED TO SING "WE SHALL OVERCOME."
AND SHE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER WITH HER BARNYARD FRIENDS AND GREW
FAT ON THE HANDOUTS OF CORN FROM THE KIND FARMER.
BUT SOMETIMES HER NEIGHBORS WONDERED WHY SHE BUILT NO MORE
HAM STATIONS.
