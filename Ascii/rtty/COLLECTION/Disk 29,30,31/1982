
                         WHAT IS AN AMERICAN?


   AN AMERICAN IS NOT DELINEATED BY A PARTICULAR SKIN COLOR, OR WAY
OF LIFE. HE IS A PERSON FROM MANY PLACES WITH MANY SHADES OF SKIN;
OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND VARIED ENERGIES. HE HAS A MASTERS DEGREE, OR
HE MAY NEVER HAVE FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL. HE MAY DRIVE AN EXPENSIVE AUTO-
MOBILE, OR PERHAPS HE RELIES ON TWO MULES TO CARVE HIS LIVING OUT
OF THE EARTH. BUT REGARDLESS OF WHAT HE IS, LACING THE DIFFERENT
PHYSICAL FEATURES TOGETHER IS A BOND OF STRENGTH IN TRADITION WHICH
EXEMPLIFIES THE AMERICAN WAY; A WAY WHICH OPENS THE DOORS OF OPPOR-
TUNITY TO ALL PEOPLE WHO MAY KNOCK UPON THEM.  AN AMERICAN HAS A SPIRIT
WHICH WAS BORN WHEN THE BELLS TOLLED OF INDEPENDENCE AND WHICH HAS
RELEASED THE ADRENAL OF THIS NATION TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHEN ITS
EXISTENCE WAS THREATENED BY AN AGGRESSOR.

   AN AMERICAN DOES NOT VIEW ARMED CONFLICT AS A MEANS OF GETTING WHAT
HE WANTS, BUT RATHER A MEANS OF PROTECTING WHAT HE HAS. HE IS ONE
WHO LOVES THE VERY CONCEPT OF PEACE FOR ALL NATIONS, BUT WILL NOT
HESITATE TO FIGHT ON THE SHORES OF OTHERS IF REQUIRED TO PROTECT
HIS OWN. AN AMERICAN SEES THE KNOWLEDGE OF EXPERIENCE IN THE PAST,
FEELS PRIDE IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE PRESENT AND HAS HOPE FOR
THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD, EVEN WHEN OTHERS WOULD VIEW THE DAYS TO COME
WITH DISMAY, BUT A REALISTIC AMERICAN FINDS NO GUARANTEE OF FREEDOM
OR SECURITY IN THE FUTURE SOLELY BECAUSE HE HAS ALWAYS HAD IT IN
THE PAST.

   AN AMERICAN RECOGNIZES THE FAULTS OF HIS SYSTEM AND SEEKS TO
CORRECT THEM THROUGH A PROCESS UNKNOWN TO MANY NATIONS. A PROCESS WHICH
DOES NOT PROMISE ABSOLUTE PERFECTION BUT ONE WHICH ALLOWS FOR PEACE-
FUL CHANGE, IF CHANGE IS NEEDED.  THAT PROCESS IS DEMOCRACY, AND AN
AMERICAN HOLDS THAT WORD SO DEAR, THAT HE STANDS READY AT A MOMENTS
NOTICE TO LAY HIS LIFE DOWN FOR ITS PERPETUATION.

   AN AMERICAN FINDS NOTHING AT ALL UNUSUAL ABOUT GETTING COLD CHILLS
WHEN HIS FLAG PASSES IN REVIEW, FOR HIS FLAG HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SOURCE
OF INSPIRATION: WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARED OVER FORT MC HENRY, WHEN ITS
SHEEN WAS REFLECTED ON THE SANDS OF IWO JIMA, AND, WHEN THE COLORS
GLISTENED ON THE SIDE OF THE CRAFT WHICH TOOK THE FIRST MAN TO THE
MOON. AN AMERICAN SEES NOTHING STRANGE ABOUT GETTING A LUMP IN HIS
THROAT WHEN THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IS PLAYED, OR WEEPING UNASHAMED WHEN
TAPS IS PLAYED FOR ONE WHO PAYED THE ULTIMATE PRICE FOR HIS FREEDOM.
ITSELF. AN AMERICAN NEVER FORGETS THE INDEBTEDNESS HE HAS BECAUSE OF
THAT SACRIFICE, FOR WITHOUT IT, HIS FREEDOM WOULD ONLY BE AN UNREACH-
ABLE CONCEPT IN SOME PHILOSOPHER'S MIND.

   A TRUE AMERICAN IS THE ESSENCE OF PRIDE IN A WAY OF LIFE. WHAT IS
AN AMERICAN YOU SAY?  HE IS FORTUNATE . . . . .
