
                 SEVENTEEN RULES FOR THE WITLESS

                  HOW TO SUCCED WITHOUT TALENT

1.  STUDY TO LOOK TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT.

2.  SPEAK WITH GREAT ASSURANCE - STICKING CLOSELY, HOWEVER, TO
    GENERALLY ACCEPTED FACTS.

3.  AVOID ARGUMENTS, BUT IF CHALLENGED, FIRE AN IRRELEVANT QUESTION
    AT YOUR ANTAGONIST AND INTENTLY POLISH YOUR GLASSES WHILE HE TRIES
    TO ANSWER.  AS AN ALTERNATIVE, HUM UNDER YOUR BREATH WHILE
    EXAMINING YOUR FINGERNAILS.

4.  CONTRIVE TO MINGLE WITH IMPORTANT PEOPLE.

5.  BEFORE TALKING WITH A MAN YOU WISH TO IMPRESS, FERRET OUT HIS
    REMEDIES FOR CURRENT PROBLEMS, THEN ADVOCATE THEM STRONGLY.

6.  LISTEN WHILE OTHERS WRANGLE, THEN PLUCK OUT A PLATITUDE AND DEFEND
    IT RIGHTEOUSLY.

7.  WHEN ASKED A QUESTION BY A SUBORDINATE, GIVE HIM A 'HAVE YOU LOST
    YOUR MIND'  STARE UNTIL HE GLANCES DOWN, THEN PARAPHRASE THE
    QUESTION BACK TO HIM.

8.  ACQUIRE A CAPABLE STOOGE, BUT KEEP HIM IN THE BACKGROUND.

9.  IN OFFERING TO PERFORM A SERVICE, IMPLY YOUR COMPLETE FAMILIARITY.

10. ARRANGE TO BE THE CLEARING HOUSE FOR ALL COMPLAINTS. IT ENCOURAGES
    THE THOUGHT THAT YOU ARE IN CONTROL AND ENABLS YOU TO KEEP THE
    STOOGE IN HIS PLACE.

11. NEVER ACKNOWLEDGE THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION-- THIS WILL IMPLANT
    SUBCONSCIOUS OBLIGATION IN THE MIND OF YOUR VICTIM.

12. CARRY YOURSELF IN THE GRAND MANNER.  REFER TO YOUR ASSOCIATES AS
    "SOME OF THE BOYS IN OUR OFFICE".  DISCOURAGE LIGHT CONVERSATION
    THAT MIGHT BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN BOSS AND MAN.

13. WALK SWIFTLY FROM PLACE TO PLACE AS IF ENGROSSED IN AFFAIRS OF
    GREAT MOMENT.  KEEP YOUR OFFICE DOOR CLOSED..  INTERVIEW BY
    APPOINTMENT ONLY.  GIVE ORDERS BY MEMORANDA.  REMEMBER, YOU ARE
    A BIG SHOT AND YOU DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHO KNOWS IT.

14. NEVER AGREE WITH ANY IDEA OR CHANGE UNLESS YOU PROPOSED IT FIRST.

15. BUILD YOURSELF AN EMPIRE BY REQUIRING DETAILED STUDIES AND
    VOLUMINOUS INFORMATION FROM A BUSY DEPARTMENT.  AFTER THE DEPART-
    MENT CHIEF AND HIS WORKERS ARE SNOWED UNDER WITH THE ADDED WORK-
    LOAD, BE MAGNANIMOUS AND OFFER TO HEAD UP THE DEPARTMENT SO THAT
    THE PRESENT CHIEF CAN ATTEND TO THE DETAILS.

16. INCREASE YOUR EMPIRE BY CHANGING THE OFFICE MODUS OPERANDI TO
    MAKE IT MORE INTRICATE THUS REQUIRING MORE WORKERS.

17. NEVER COORDINATE ANYTHING WITH ANYONE SINCE THAT IMPLIES THAT YOU
    ARE NOT THE BIG SHOT THAT YOU WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW YOU ARE.
