XX                    WHAT A PATROLMAN IS MADE OF                      XX
XX                                                                     XX
XX                                                                     XX
XX    A PATROLMAN IS A COMPOSITE OF WHAT ALL MEN ARE - A MINGLING      XX
XX      OF SAINT AND SINNER,DUST AND DEITY. CULLED STASTICS WAVE THE   XX
XX      FAN OVER A STINKER AND UNDERSCORE INSTANCES OF DISHONESTY      XX
XX      AND BRUTALITY, BUT THESE ARE BOTH EXCEPTIONAL AND UNUSUAL.     XX
XX      THE FACT IS THAT LESS THAN HALF OF ONE PERCENT OF PATROLMAN    XX
XX      MISFIT THAT UNIFORM AND THAT IS A BETTER AVERAGE THAN YOU'D    XX
XX      FIND AMONG CLERGYMEN.                                          XX
XX                                                                     XX
XX    HE OF ALL MEN IS AT ONCE THE MOST NEEDED AND LEAST WANTED.       XX
XX      HE IS A STRANGELY NAMELESS CREATURE WHO IS "SIR" TO HIS        XX
XX      FACE AND "FUZZ" BEHIND HIS BACK. HE MUST BE SUCH A DIPLOMAT    XX
XX      THAT HE CAN SETTLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SO THAT     XX
XX      EACH WILL THINK HE WON. BUT IF A PATROLMAN IS NEAT, HE'S       XX
XX      CONCIETED; IF HE'S SLOPPY, HE'S A BUM; IF HE'S PLEASENT, HE'S  XX
XX      A FLIRT, IF HE'S NOT , HE'S A GROUCH. HE MUST MAKE IN AN       XX
XX      INSTANT DECISIONS WHICH WOULD REQUIRE MONTHS FOR A LAWYER      XX
XX      BUT IF HE HURRIES , HE'S CARELESS; IF HE'S DELIBERATE,         XX
XX      HE'S LAZY.                                                     XX
XX                                                                     XX
XX    HE MUST BE FIRST TO AN ACCIDENT , INFALLIBLE WITH A DIAGNOSIS.   XX
XX      HE MUST BE ABLE TO START BREATHING,STOP BLEEDING,TIE SPLINTS   XX
XX      AND ABOVE ALL, BE SURE THE VICTIM GOES HOME WITHOUT A LIMP     XX
XX      OR EXPECT TO BE SUED.                                          XX
XX                                                                     XX
XX    A  PATROLMAN MUST KNOW EVERY GUN, DRAW ON THE RUN AND HIT WHERE  XX
XX      IT DOESN'T HURT. HE MUST BE ABLE TO WHIP TWO MEN TWICE HIS     XX
XX      SIZE AND HALF HIS AGE WITHOUT DIRTYING HIS UNIFORM AND WITHOUT XX
XX      BEING BRUTAL. IF YOU HIT HIM, HE'S A COWARD;IF HE HITS YOU     XX
XX      HE'S A BULLY.                                                  XX
XX                                                                     XX
XX    A PATROLMAN MUST KNOW EVERYTHING AND NOT TELL. HE MUST KNOW      XX
XX      WHERE ALL THE SIN IS AND NOT PARTAKE, HE MUST, FROM A SINGLE   XX
XX      DENT, BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE THE WRECK, THE DRIVERS AND SAY       XX
XX      WHO'S AT FAULT. IF HE MAKES A CASE HE'S LUCKY; IF HE DOESN'T   XX
XX      HE'S SLACK. IF HE GETS PROMOTED, HE HAS POLITICAL PULL; IF     XX
XX      HE DOESN'T HE'S NOT READY YET.                                 XX
XX                                                                     XX
XX    A  PATROLMAN MUST TRY AND ENFORCE OUR LAWS AND PROTECT OUR       XX
XX      LIVES WHILE JEPRODIZING HIS. A DAYS WORK DOESN'T END WITH      XX
XX      THE SHIFT, BECAUSE WORK CALL GOES AROUND THE CLOCK. WHEN       XX
XX      HIS OFF TIME FINALLY COMES , EVEN THAT IS NOT HIS. IT MUST     XX
XX      BE SHARED WITH REPORTS, THAT ENDLESS STREAM OF PAPERS AND      XX
XX      CARBONS, COURT APPERANCES, TO WATCH HIS EFFORTS TERMINATED     XX
XX      BY A TECHNICALITY OR FAVOR.                                    XX
XX                                                                     XX
XX    A  PATROLMAN MUST BE A DIPLOMAT, MEDIC, TOUGH GUY, SECRETARY     XX
XX      AND GENTLEMAN. AND OF COURSE, HE'LL HAVE TO BE A GENIUS        XX
XX      BECAUSE HE'LL HAVE TO FEED A FAMILY ON A PATROLMANS SALARY.    XX
XX                                                                     XX
XX                                                                     XX
