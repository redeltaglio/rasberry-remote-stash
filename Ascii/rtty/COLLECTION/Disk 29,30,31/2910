1. EACH PLAYER SHALL FURNISH HIS OWN EQUIPMENT, NORMALIY ONE CLUB
   AND TWO BALLS.

2. PLAYING ON A COURSE MUST BE APPROVED BY THE OWNER OF THE HOLE.

3. UNLIKE OUTDOOR GOLF,THE OBJECT IS TO GET THE CLUB IN THE HOLE
   AND KEEP THE BALLS OUT OF THE HOLE.

4. FOR MOST EFFECTIVE PLAY, THE CLUB SHOULD HAVE A FIRM SHAFT.
   COURSE OWNERS ARE PERMITTED TO CHECK SHAFT STIFFNESS BEFORE PLAY
   BEGINS.

5. COURSE OWNERS RESERVE THE RIGHT TO RESTRICT THE LENGTH OF THE
   CLUB TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE HOLE.

6. THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO TAKE AS MANY STROKES AS NECESSARY
   UNTIL THE COURSE OWNER IS SATISFIED THAT PLAY IS COMPLETE.
   FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN BEING DENIED PERMISSION TO PLAY
   THE COURSE AGAIN.

7. IT IS CONSIDERED BAD FORM TO BEGIN PLAYING THE HOLE IMMEDIATLY
   UPON ARRIVAL AT THE COURSE. THE EXPERIENCED PLAYER WILL NORMALLY
   TAKE TIME TO ADMIRE THE COURSE, WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE
   WELL-FORMED BUNKERS.

8. PLAYERS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO MENTION OTHER COURSES THEY HAVE
   PLAYED OR ARE CURRENTLY PLAYING.

    PROPERLY SCHEDULED PARTICULARLY WHEN A NEW COURSE IS BEING

    BECOME IRATE IF THEY DISCOVER SOMONE ELSE PLAYING WHAT THEY
    CONSIDER TO BE A PRIVATE COURSE.

11. PLAYERS SHOULD NOT ASSUME A COURSE IS IN SHAPE FOR PLAY AT ALL
    TIMES. SOME PLAYERS MAY BE EMBARRASSED IF THEY FIND THE COURSE
    TO BE TEMPORARALY UNDER REPAIR. PLAYERS ARE ADVISED TO BE
    EXTREMELY TACTFUL IN THIS SITUATION. MORE ADVANCED PLAYERS WILL
    FIND ALTERNATE MEANS OF PLAY WHEN THIS IS THE CASE.

12. PLAYERS ARE ADVISED TO OBTAIN THE COURSE OWNERS PERMISSION BEFORE
    ATTEMPTING TO PLAY THE BACK NINE.

13. SLOW PLAY IS ENCOURAGED: HOWEVER, PLAYERS SHOULD BE PREPARED TO
    PROCEED AT A QUICKER PACE AT LEAST TEMPORARLY AT THE OWNERS
    REQUEST.

14. IT IS CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE, TIME PERMITTING, TO
    PLAY THE SAME HOLE SEVERAL TIMES IN ONE MATCH

15. THE COURSE OWNER WILL BE THE SOLE JUDGE OF WHO IS THE BEST PLAYER

16. PLAYERS ARE ADVISED TO THINK TWICE BEFORE CONSIDERING MEMBERSHIP
    AT A GIVEN COURSE. ADDITONAL ASSESSMENTS MAY BE DENIED BY THE
    COURSE OWNER AND THE RULES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.
    FOR THIS REASON MANY PLAYERS PREFER TO CONTINUE TO PLAY SEVERAL
    DIFFERANT COURSES.
